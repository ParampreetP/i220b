::::File Character Count::::

Need to add a fclose(in) at the end

::::Buffering::::

Contents of the buffer are written from the user space buffer to a kernel space buffer. However, when we pass a 
"1" in the command line, fgetc() is used which flows from the kernel buffer to the stdio buffer, which is alot faster.
